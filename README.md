# Game Hub Project Demo

This project was created using Vite, React + TypeScript, while the styling was done using ChakraUI, and the data was fetched using the API from rawg.io.

For the next steps, I am going to implement caching, infinite scrolling (game list), better state management and routing (game single page).

The application can be previewed by accessing this link: https://davidardelean7.github.io/game-hub/ .
