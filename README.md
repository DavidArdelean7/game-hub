# Game Hub Project Demo

This project was created using Vite, React + TypeScript, while the styling was done using ChakraUI, and the data was fetched using the API from rawg.io.

Caching is implemented using React Query library; also I have used Zustand for better state management which is a simple, no-boilerplate react library. Besides that, I added routing using React Router.

The application can be previewed by accessing this link: https://davidardelean7.github.io/game-hub/ .
