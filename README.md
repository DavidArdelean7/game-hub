# Game Hub Project Demo

This project was creating using Vite, React + TypeScript, while the styling was done using ChakraUI, and the data was fetched using the API from rawg.io.

For the next steps, I am going to implement caching, infinite scrolling (game list), better state management and routing (game single page).



I am still learning, but I am so elated because I finally found something that I really like (in terms of coding).
